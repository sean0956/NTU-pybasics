file containing executable statements and definitions.\n","* A file containing Python code, for e.g.: **example.py**, is called a module and its module name would be **example**.\n","* We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files. \n","* Modules are usually used as libraries, and provide reusability of code.\n","\n","We can define our most used functions in a module and import it, instead of copying their definitions into different programs.\n","\n","Python has only one type of module object, and all modules are of this type, regardless of whether the module is implemented in Python, C, or something else. \n","\n","## Packages in Python\n","To help organize modules and provide a naming hierarchy, Python has a concept of **packages**.\n","\n","* You can think of packages as the directories on a file system and modules as files within directories\n","  * but donâ€™t take this analogy too literally since packages and modules need not originate from the file system. \n","* Like file system directories, **packages** are organized hierarchically, and packages may themselves contain **subpackages**, as well as regular **modules**.\n","\n","\n","Packages are also considered as modules\n","* Namely, packages are just a special kind of module. \n","* Specifically, any module that contains a __path__ attribute is considered a package.\n","\n","### Module and package naming\n","All modules have a name. \n","* Subpackage names are separated from their parent package name by dots. \n","* For example, you might have a module called sys and a package called email, which in turn has a subpackage called email.mime and a module within that subpackage called email.mime.text.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"OnGJq-Lndnab","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Module example\n","def add(a, b):\n","   \"\"\"adds two numbers and return
